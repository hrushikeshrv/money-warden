# Money Warden

![Money Warden](../assets/images/logo.png)

A budgeting app using Google Sheets as a backing store.

Money Warden stores all your transaction data in a Google Sheet that you create. None of your
data is ever sent to any external service except the Google Sheet created _in your Google
account_. All the features provided by the app (CRUD transactions, CRUD transaction categories,
and everything else) are backed by either the single Google Sheet or by your device's local storage.

This also allows you to run any custom analytics you want on your transactions in an
Excel environment, letting you go beyond the standard analytics offered by any budgeting app.
You can share your transaction data with others by simply sharing the Google Sheet with them.

Money Warden is completely open source, and all contributions are welcome!

Please report any issues you face or request any new features on this repository's
[issues page](https://github.com/hrushikeshrv/money-warden/issues).
